[![Release Status](https://travis-ci.org/wifi-positioning/WiFi-Trilateration.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/wifi-positioning/WiFi-Trilateration) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/wifi-positioning/WiFi-Trilateration.svg?branch=WT-dev)](https://travis-ci.org/wifi-positioning/WiFi-Trilateration)


#### Overview
  In this repository there is the simple implementation of methods for indoor positioning.
  First method: "Fingerprinting"
in this method, a map of radio space is taken in advance to further compare the reference with the results.

  Second method: "Trilateration"
This method based on _received signal strength indicator of wireless network_ (aka **WiFi RSSI**) through `Telnet`/`SSH`-connection and client's requests.

  All needed information will be upload on the project's [Wiki](https://github.com/wifi-positioning/WiFi-Trilateration/wiki "Wiki") as soon as possible. (Certainly not)
